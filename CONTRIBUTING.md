## How to Contribute

To contribute to this project, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Create a new branch for your contribution: `git checkout -b BRANCHNAME`
3. Add your changes to the staging area: `git add [path of files]`
4. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add new feature'`

6. Submit a pull request.

## Quick Guide

### Prerequisites

```shell
bun: ">=1.1.12"
```

### Setting up your local repo

Orbitkit uses bun workspaces, so you should **always run `bun install` from the top-level project directory**. Running `bun install` in the top-level project root will install dependencies for `Orbitkit`, and every package in the repo.

```shell
git clone && cd ...
bun install
bun turbo build
```

### Setting up environment variables

Checkout the `.env.example` file inside the `apps/web` directory for the environment variables you need to get the project running. You should create an UploadThing and Neon DB accounts and copy the environment variables from their dashboard to a `.env.local` file in `apps/web`.

You will also need to create a GitHub Oauth token as well as for Google authentication as well.

### Using GitHub Codespaces for development

To get started, create a codespace for this repository by clicking this ðŸ‘‡

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/ixahmedxi/orbitkit)

Your new codespace will open in a web-based version of Visual Studio Code. All development dependencies will be preinstalled, and the tests will run automatically ensuring you've got a green base from which to start working.

### Development

```shell
# Dev
bun turbo dev

# Build
bun turbo build

# Typecheck
bun turbo typecheck

# Lint
bun turbo lint

# Storybook
bun turbo storybook

# Start apps in production mode
bun turbo start
```

If you're familiar with turborepo / bun workspaces, running stuff around this repo will be easy to figure out.

### Other useful commands

```shell
# auto-format the entire project
bun run format
```

```shell
# lint the project
