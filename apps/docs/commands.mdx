<Note>
  OrbitKit uses Turborepo to run commands across apps & packages in the
  monorepo, you can also use `bun --filter` commands to do the same without
  dependant tasks running or caching.
</Note>

## `dev`

```bash
bun turbo dev
```

The `dev` command starts up all of the apps in the monorepo in development mode and also starts up the watch mode on the packages that need bundling.

The `dev` command also applies Drizzle ORM schema migrations to the database, it will generate any missing migrations and apply them to the database.

You can start up for example only the web application by using `bun turbo dev --filter=@orbitkit/web`.

## `build`

```bash
bun turbo build
```

The `build` command builds all of the apps in the monorepo and also builds the packages that need bundling.

You can build for example only the web application by using `bun turbo build --filter=@orbitkit/web`.

## `start`

```bash
bun turbo start
```

The `start` command starts up all of the apps in the monorepo in production mode. This is done after building all of the apps & packages automatically via turborepo dependant tasks, so you don't need to build before you run the start command.

## `lint`

```bash
bun turbo lint
```

The `lint` command runs ESLint on all of the apps & packages in the monorepo.

## `typecheck`

```bash
bun turbo typecheck
```

The `typecheck` command runs TypeScript type checking on all of the apps & packages in the monorepo.

## `storybook`

```bash
bun turbo storybook
```

The `storybook` command starts up the `ui` package storybook instance in dev mode.

## `build-storybook`

```bash
bun turbo build-storybook
```

The `build-storybook` command builds the `ui` package storybook application, you will find the output in a `storybook-static` in the `packages/ui` directory.

## `db:generate`

```bash
bun turbo db:generate
```

The `db:generate` command will generate new schema migration files when necessary (based on the typescript schema files in `packages/db/src/schema` directory).

## `db:migrate`

```bash
bun turbo db:generate
```

The `db:migrate` command will apply all of the schema migrations to the database.

## Database Commands

OrbitKit supports all of [DrizzleKit's commands](https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/commands) which are all configured for you in the `packages/db/package.json` file.

You can invoke these commands using `bun`, for example to check for collisions and inconsistencies between your database and the schema, you can run `bun --filter @orbitkit/db db:check`.
