## Motivation

The process of orchestrating a new codebase that will be used for a serious project is almost always very time consuming. **You need to:**

1. Pick a tech stack.
2. Configure your monorepo with all the tools like linting, formatting, typescript configuration...etc.
3. Decide your packages and connect them all together with the apps.
4. Configure task caching with something like [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) or [NX](https://nx.dev)
5. Configure your Github Actions pipelines.
6. Figure out deployment.
7. Start building...

You see, there are so many steps you have to go through with a monorepo architecture before you actually get to building, we get you towards that last step and move it to be your first.

Many people choose to start small and eventually when they need to, move to a monorepo setup in the future, even though they know they will need it soon, this is just delaying the inevitable.

**With OrbitKit, the development phases transform into:**

1. Copy over OrbitKit.
2. Change OrbitKit references in the codebase to your product name.
3. Start building...

**And the best part is that these are minute(s) long steps, not potentially hours long!**
