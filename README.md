## Note

> [!IMPORTANT]
> OrbitKit is built on top of a very opinionated tech stack, which might not work for every use case/business idea. I offer monorepo architecture consulting or even building something completely custom for you, if you are interested be sure to [DM me on X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/ixahmedxii).

## Features
